## ✨ What is Designanimals?

Designanimals combines psychology, interaction design, and real-time analysis to determine your "design animal" - a metaphorical representation of your creative approach. By simply moving your mouse across a grid, the application analyzes your movement patterns and matches them to one of eight carefully crafted animal archetypes.

### 🎯 Core Concept

- **Destroy to Create**: Move your mouse to break down a structured grid system
- **Real-time Analysis**: Three key metrics are tracked (Speed, Pattern, Range)
- **Personality Matching**: Your movements reveal your design philosophy
- **Artistic Visualization**: Hand-drawn silhouettes emerge from your interactions
